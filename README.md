Land Cover Classification Project


The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts land cover types based on geospatial data and provides probability scores for each category solely using python.

Overall, it is much harder to do than in Google Earth Engine but it is a good approach since we are using open source solution which don't need license

Installation & Requirements
- Have installed Python, at least version 3.9
- Know how to code, some machine learning, and remote sensing knowledge (if don't please learn some first! it is for your own good!)

Prerequisites
Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Results & Findings
- The Random Forest model provided accurate predictions for each land cover class.
- Feature normalization and proper encoding improved model performance.

Recommendations
- Include additional geospatial features such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to enhance predictions.
